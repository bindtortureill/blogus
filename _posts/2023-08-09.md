The city stands sprawled haphazardly over a cluster of islands at the end of a long and mountainous peninsula, a chaotic and narrow archipelago called the Dogteeth by sailors. these islands are flanked on the opposite side from the peninsula by a wide island of marsh rainforest, where a small vessel can disappear into mangroves as if swallowed up by jungle itself. the Dogteeth are rocky islands, surrounded by reefs and sandbars, which would be good enough at destroying poorly-piloted sailing ships even were it not for their hospitability to a teeming infestation of pirates. 



the Dogteeth sit at the end of a strait, through which flows the world's most valuable maritime trade route. 



and just before the first of the Teeth lies a set of undulating islands, hatched by wide rivers, flanked by wide straits, pocked with ramshackle harbors and old plantations. built here, on stilts and wood bridges, is the port city of Gaul Tenach. It bears no resemblance to any other city in the grand kingdoms of the world; it looks more like some meddling deity took a few hundreds from each city and sprinkled them here in the forest. It has had twenty conquerors and now stands free, and alone. Each time a new king has attempted to use its strategic location to collect port fees. Each time, in turn, they have discontinued enforcement after new ports cropped up on the city's periphery and filled to capacity with thieves and bordellos.
